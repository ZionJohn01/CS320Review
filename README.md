Software Test Automation QA Project Review

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Although this approach can be slower, I believe taking my time with the code to fully test 100% of the program can significantly improve the functionality. 
  Creating a test for each method and considering edge cases when developing will save me more time in the long run.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  The best way to start this process is to be incredibly comprehensive when collecting the requirements of the software. This way there is no miscommunication or misunderstandings that come along during the development stage.
  Then, when developing it is best to stay as true as possible to these requirements so that there is no shock when presenting the application.

How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software it depends really on if I am the truly the one designing it from top to bottom or if I am simple designing based on someone else's preferences.
  When designing someone else's application I try to collect as much information from them as possible and try to stick to it as closely as possible.
  If it is my application that I am designing I try to map everything out and break each feature into smaller parts. I ask myself more questions like 'is this necessary' or 'will this actually add to the application in any positive way'.
